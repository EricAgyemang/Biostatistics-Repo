# INTRODUCTION:

  SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a statistical package designed for data base management and statistical analysis. Biology uses SAS 9.4 for Windows, which is available on    
  computers in SLB 121 and many of the laboratories in the department. It can be set up to run on any IBM- compatible computer in the department (see me if you need to get it set up   in your laboratory).
  Nearly all internal statements, commands, and procedures are identical to those used in every other version of SAS. The main differences are in the interface that is, the   
  mechanisms for submitting, calling files, and printing output, and in the on-screen viewing of input and output. The interface for SAS works much like other programs that run in 
  Windows (e.g., Word, Excel). You will find that the Windows version of SAS has a user-friendly interface and program editor. Possibilities for using SAS and interfacing SAS 
  programming with other Windows programs (e.g., Excel, Word, PowerPoint) are numerous and complex, and we will only deal with the simpler aspects of such programming.
 
  This handout is designed to introduce you to the use of SAS in the Windows environment. This handout will NOT teach you to use fully the SAS graphic interface and command language.   SAS consists of hundreds of separate procedures, each with 10-200 subcommands and options, plus the DATA step, with hundreds of subcommands, functions, and many variable formats.  
  There are numerous SAS windows for specialized jobs. It therefore takes much more than a single handout to introduce SAS. The handout gives the minimum information necessary for 
  using SAS on the departmental computers in the computer room (SLB 121). Once you know how to start SAS, use the basic windows, submit, save, and print input and output, and how to 
  get on-line help, you can quickly teach yourself SAS windows, language, and procedures by using on-line help. More information on manuals is given below - sections E.


# STARTING SAS:

   To start SAS on computers in the Biological Sciences computer room (SLB 121):
   1)	The computers should be on, with Windows running.
   2)	In Windows, locate the SAS icon on the Desktop or Start menu
   3)	Double click


# USING SAS

  A.	The screen. The SAS screen (Fig. 1, next page) is controlled by the DISPLAY MANAGER. There are three windows on the starting screen: the OUTPUT window, in which output of       
  procedures appears; the LOG window, in which statements submitted for processing, along with error messages appear; and the ENHANCED PROGRAM EDITOR or EPE window, in which you type 
  input statements. Other windows appear as commands are given. SAS for Windows operates much like other Windows programs (e.g., Word, Excel). To move between windows, simply left 
  click on the destination window. You can also enter window names in the command slot (upper left, Fig. 1) and hit ENTER (throughout this handout, keys to be hit will be shown in 
  bold Arial type, SAS screen buttons or menu items to be clicked will be shown in bold Times Roman type). You can tell which window is active by the location of the cursor (which 
  can be hard to see) and by the color of the window banner (top). Any window may be expanded to fill the entire screen by clicking on the icons in the upper right hand corner of 
  each window (Fig. 1) You can shrink a window to an icon by clicking on the little icon with a ‘—’. You can also go to different windows via the VIEW menu.
